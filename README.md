## 📋 Abstract

Freshwater ecosystems are facing a crisis with extinction rates of aquatic species exceeding those of their terrestrial counterparts by up to fivefold. This study examines the distribution and habitat requirements of winter stonefly species (*Allocapnia* spp.) across three major river systems in Northwest Arkansas—one of the fastest-growing regions in the United States.

### Key Research Questions

1. How does land use (forest, agriculture, urban) affect *Allocapnia* species presence and richness?
2. What are the critical land-use thresholds beyond which species richness declines significantly?
3. What is the current conservation status of three Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN)?

## 🔬 Research Highlights

### Study Design
- **22 sampling sites** across three river systems
- **Two winter seasons** of intensive sampling (2020-2022)
- **Average of 10 visits per site** during emergence periods
- **Over 5,000 specimens** collected and identified

### Key Findings

**Species Distribution:**
- *Allocapnia rickeri* and *A. mohri* were most abundant (54% and 43% of specimens)
- *A. jeanae* showed successful regional expansion over 50 years
- *A. ozarkana* persists but in very low numbers
- *A. warreni* likely extirpated from Clear Creek

**Land-Use Thresholds:**
Critical points where species richness significantly declined:
- **Forest cover:** < 64.3% (±25.17)
- **Agriculture:** > 26.19% (±5.18)
- **Urban development:** > 8.56% (±0.74)
- **Impervious surface:** > 1.51% (±0.16)

**Conservation Implications:**
- No *Allocapnia* found at heavily urbanized sites
- Species can persist with moderate agricultural development
- Forested headwater protection is critical

## 🛠️ Methods & Technologies

### Field Methods
- Timed searches on emergent structures (20 min/visit)
- Hand collection of adult specimens
- Species identification via morphological keys

### Analytical Approaches
- **Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Regression (OPLS)** for multivariate analysis
- **Threshold analysis** to identify critical land-use values
- **GIS analysis** using QGIS and ArcGIS for watershed delineation
- **R statistical programming** for all analyses

### Datasets
- Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium's National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2019
- Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality stream classifications
- Historical stonefly survey data (1971, 1991)

## 🌍 Ecological Context

### Why This Matters

**Freshwater biodiversity crisis:**
- Aquatic species extinction rates 5× higher than terrestrial
- Land-use change is a primary driver
- Northwest Arkansas population growing 32% per decade since 1980

**Ecosystem services provided by *Allocapnia*:**
- Primary consumers linking riparian and aquatic nutrient cycling
- Food source for fish and riparian predators
- Biological indicators of stream health
- Shredders of leaf litter (detritivores)

**Conservation status:**
- Three SGCN species: *A. jeanae*, *A. ozarkana*, *A. warreni*
- Arkansas Wildlife Action Plan priority scores: 50-80 (scale 0-100)

## 📊 Major Results Summary

| Species | Status | Distribution Pattern |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| *A. rickeri* | Common | Large, high-order streams; moderate agricultural tolerance |
| *A. mohri* | Common | Co-occurs with *A. rickeri*; earlier emergence |
| *A. jeanae* | Uncommon | Headwater tributaries; expanded range over 50 years |
| *A. ozarkana* | Rare | Small watersheds; limited dispersal; 10 specimens total |
| *A. warreni* | Extirpated | Not found; last collected 1962 |

## 🎯 Conservation Recommendations

1. **Protect forested headwaters** - Maintain >64% forest cover in watersheds
2. **Riparian buffer zones** - Preserve streamside vegetation in agricultural areas
3. **Stormwater management** - Limit impervious surfaces to <1.5% of watershed
4. **Dispersal corridors** - Maintain connectivity between suitable habitats
5. **Continued monitoring** - Track species responses to ongoing development
